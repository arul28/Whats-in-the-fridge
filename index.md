## Honey! What's in the fridge?

What if there was an easier way to know what’s in your fridge?

The main focus of our project was to create a machine learning model with multi-label classification that could recognize everything in our fridge with just a picture. 

Obviously, this sort of idea is useless on its own, but the possible implementations could be hugely advantageous. Given just a weeks time, we just wanted to create the basis for such a project, which is the multi label classification. We trained chicken breasts, raw pork, milk, oranges, apples, bread, carrots, and broccoli.
